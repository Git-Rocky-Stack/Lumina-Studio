# Lumina Studio Design System

Welcome to the **Lumina Studio Design System** - a comprehensive, production-ready React component library built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

## Overview

This design system provides 40+ accessible, animated components designed for professional creative applications. Every component is built with:

- **Accessibility First** - WCAG AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Framer Motion Animations** - Spring physics, micro-interactions, gesture support
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first with responsive props and breakpoint utilities
- **Dark Mode** - Seamless light/dark theme switching
- **TypeScript** - Complete type definitions with IntelliSense support

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install framer-motion lucide-react clsx tailwind-merge
```

### Quick Start

```tsx
import { Button } from './design-system/components/Button';
import { Card, CardBody } from './design-system/components/Card';

function App() {
  return (
    <Card variant="elevated">
      <CardBody>
        <h2>Hello World</h2>

## Design Principles

### 1. Accessibility First
Every component is built with accessibility as a core requirement. We follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards and implement proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.

### 2. Animation with Purpose
Animations enhance user experience without sacrificing performance. Components respect `prefers-reduced-motion` settings automatically.

### 3. Composable Architecture
Components are designed to work together. Use composition patterns to build complex UIs from simple building blocks.

### 4. Type Safety
Full TypeScript support ensures type safety and excellent developer experience with IntelliSense.
